Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm 
primarily used for classification and regression tasks. Developed by Vladimir Vapnik 
and his colleagues in the 1990s, SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximally 
separates different classes in a high-dimensional feature space. The algorithm identifies 
support vectors, which are the data points closest to the decision boundary, and uses them 
to define the margin between classes. SVM aims to maximize this margin, making it robust to 
outliers and providing good generalization performance on unseen data. One of the key strengths 
of SVM is the kernel trick, which allows the algorithm to efficiently handle non-linearly 
separable data by implicitly mapping input features into higher-dimensional spaces using 
kernel functions such as linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. 
SVM is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and remains memory efficient 
since it only uses a subset of training points in the decision function. Common applications
of SVM include text classification, image recognition, bioinformatics, and handwriting 
recognition, making it one of the most widely used algorithms in machine learning.
